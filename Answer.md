ANSWER NO. 1 =>

The relationship between the given two entities is -

1. The 'Product' entity represents individual products. Each product have attributes such as category ID, inventory ID, name, description, price, etc.
2. The second entity named as 'Product_Category' represents categories to which products belong. Each category have attributes such as created_at, modified_at, name, description, etc.
3. The relationship between the entities given in the question example is a one-to-many relationship.
4. In terms of database schema, this relationship is typically implemented using foreign keys. The 'Product' entity have a foreign key column referencing the primary key of the 'Product_Category' entity, indicating the category to which the product belongs. 
5. In the given question a one-to-many relationship between products and categories is shown, where each category have multiple associated products.




ANSWER NO. 2 =>

There are few ways to ensure that each product in the 'Product' table has a valid category assigned-

1. In the given example, we have to first ensure that the 'Category' column in the 'Product' table references the primary key of the "Category" table. This constraint will ensure referential integrity, meaning that each category assigned to a product must exist in the 'Category' table.
2. The second thing we can do is that before inserting any products into the 'Product' table,we must make sure that all necessary categories are present in the 'Category' table. This will prevent the assignment of non-existent categories to products.
3. To be double sure and certain, we can also implement validation checks in the application code to ensure that only valid category IDs are assigned to products before performing any database operations. This adds an extra layer of validation before interacting with the database.
